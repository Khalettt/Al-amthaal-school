This is the school where I spent my childhood and graduated with wonderful memories.
I spent 7 amazing years there,
learning from inspiring teachers who shaped my knowledge
and making lifelong friends who became like family.
Every corner of this place holds special moments of growth and learning.
This website is not yet as perfect as I envisioned,
but I built it with passion using HTML, CSS, and Tailwind.
It's a small tribute to a place that played a big role in my journey.
